    "## Beverage Filling Process\n",
    "You're working as a junior quality analyst at a beverage company that produces 12-ounce soft drinks. The filling process naturally has some variation, and underfilled bottles lead to customer complaints while overfilled bottles waste product. Your supervisor has asked you to analyze the filling data. You will first address initial probability word problem questions using hypothetical data and the varying laws of probability. These scenarios represent potential uses of conditional probability and bayes theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next you will move into conducting an analysis of fill data using properties of the normal distribution. Recent studies suggest that customers notice when bottles are underfilled by more than 0.3 ounces, while overfilling by more than 0.2 ounces impacts company profits. This information has been used to set quality control rejection limits of 11.7 and 12.2 oz. You'll need to analyze the fill amounts, determine if they follow a normal distribution, and establish if the company’s current fill process is within acceptable control limits. They would like to achieve a maximum rejection percentage of 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your analysis needs to answer three key questions:\n",
    "- Does the filling process follow a normal distribution?\n",
    "- What are the probabilities of under-filling (less than 11.7 oz) or over-filling (more than 12.2 oz)?\n",
    "- Is the current fill process below the maximum rejection percentage of 5%?\n",
